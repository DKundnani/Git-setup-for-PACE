## About me

I am a Ph.D. Student in the Bioinformatics department of Georgia Institute of Technology studying the role of rNMPs incorporated in the human genome to answer how DNA damage and repair mechanisms play a role in epigenetic changes leading a nornal healthy cell in our body to a diseased/abnormal state. The study is based on the data generated by Riboseq technique generated in Storici Lab. Currently my work involves categorizing rNMPs into different DNA elements using the concept of functional annotations. 

##Team 3 Project
In this repository we are utilizing well established Bioinformatic tools for Genome Assembly, Gene Prediction, Functional Annotation, Comparative Genomics and Webbased Server to analyse bacterial sequencing data and predict the invasiveness of the organism for human population. 

##Motivation
My motivation is to apply the concepts of Bioinformatics(Biology, Computation and Statistics) in aiding novel techniques move from bench side to bed side and evolve in the Translational Research.

##Strengths/Skills
I work on high computational *-nix based servers coding in python and R. Being from Biological background I also have a good grasp of experimental studies and can use it to deal with noisy biological data.
